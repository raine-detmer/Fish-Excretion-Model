Code and data associated with the manuscript "Fertilization by coral-dwelling fish promotes coral growth but can exacerbate bleaching response"


This repository contains all code used in “Fertilization by coral-dwelling fish promotes coral growth but can exacerbate bleaching response” by A.R. Detmer, R. Cunning, F. Pfab, A.L. Brown, A.C. Stier, R.M. Nisbet, and H.V. Moeller. All model simulations were performed using Mathematica v12.1.1.0, and runable code is included here as Mathematica notebooks (.nb). Pdfs of these notebooks are also included for viewing the code. The file “Fish Excretion Model Code and Figures.nb” contains the code to simulate the model presented in the manuscript and to produce figures 2, 4, 5, and 6 from the main text. The file “Fish Excretion Supplemental Figures.nb” contains the code to produce all supplemental figures.  The folder "fish excretion R project" contains all files needed to knit the “Fish excretion model parameterization.html” supplement, including the RMarkdown “Fish excretion model parameterization.Rmd”, which contains all code used in model parameterization, as well as datasets used for parameter estimation that were not previously published.
